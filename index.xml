      <description>I am currently working at Voyage Auto building decision making ingredients for autonomous driving.
Previously, I was at Apple SPG building autonomous systems, and before that I was conducting research on normative navigation behaviors for mobile service robots at the University of Freiburg as part of my PhD studies. In the more distant past, I have been fortunate to work in a number of labs including DFKI, the Manipulation lab at RI-CMU, TU-Munich, Idiap research institute among others.</description>
