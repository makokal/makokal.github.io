      <h1>About</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am currently at <a href="http://6river.com">6 River Systems</a> (a <a href="https://shopify.engineering">Shopify</a> company) working on all things robotics for application in fulfillment. See more about our robots, called Chucks <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll9Z18fMBu4">here</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, I was at <a href="http://voyage.auto">Voyage Auto</a> building decision making ingredients (behavior planning, predictions and remote discrete assistance) for autonomous driving, and before that, I was at <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple SPG</a> building autonomous systems.
Prior to venturing into industry, I was an academic conducting research on normative navigation behaviors for mobile service robots at the <a href="https://www.uni-freiburg.de">University of Freiburg</a> as part of my PhD studies.
In the more distant past, I have been fortunate to work in a number of labs including <a href="https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html">DFKI</a>, the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-area/manipulation-lab/">Manipulation lab at RI-CMU</a>, <a href="https://www.tum.de">TU-Munich</a>, <a href="http://www.idiap.ch">Idiap research institute</a> among others.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My main research interest is in sequential decision making, and how it is applied to a number of AI tasks in various domains like robotics (e.g. self driving cars, warehouse fulfillment), value alignment, intelligent behavior design, amongst others.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to learn new things. I am currently learning elixir and rust programming languages.</p>
